## Your skillset?

We could do the standard thing and publish a long list of all the programmes, tools and expertise that we want our new UX designer to be awesome at. But we won’t. If you’re an UX designer, you already know what we want. And of course you’re well-versed in matters we’ve not even heard of (yet). No, we think it’s more important to talk a bit about what a UX designer can expect from us.

## Why would you want to work here, exactly?

What drives a competent UX designer to apply to a communications agency? Okay, our clients think that UX is God’s gift to humanity. Sort of. You’ll get to work with dedicated employees who really understand how important it is work based on the user's perspective. You’re not going to end up in the shadows - just as often as you’ll be sitting in the office, puzzling over a wireframe you’ll be out at the customer and running an inspirational workshop. You’ll get to meet the end customer in real life. You’ll be given freedom (to structure your day, work from home if necessary), responsibility, variation (working with different customers, different colleagues and on different projects is really cool) and tons of opportunities (to grow, develop...well, you know).

You’ll also receive a stimulating keep-fit activity grant, fun coffee-breaks, inspirational kick-offs, a secure healthcare agreement, offices in two cities (Örebro and Stockholm, yay), and a whole lot more. We think this sounds great. Hope you do, too.

## What’s the deal with Strateg?

We started writing a whole page of well-formulated sentences about how good things are at Strateg. About that we who work here really thrive, that our customers really like us and that we frequently win fantastic awards. But we binned most of it. Because the best thing about working at Strateg is something you won’t discover until you’re here. It’s when you feel the magic when all the roles work in close symbiosis, in the way we really care about each other and have a lot of fun together.

## Time to apply?

There’s no time to lose, is there? Send a personal letter and CV to <career@strateg.se>. As long as the vacancy is visible it’s perfectly okay to apply. And you know, it starts with a temporary position for 12 months, but after that, who knows where it can end? That is to say, there is a chance of extension.
