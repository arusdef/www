## About your new role

As a developer at Strateg you’re part of a customer-centric team of around 10 people, whose mission it is to create qualitative and sustainable solutions for our customers. Strateg is a part of the Diplomat Group, so you can choose whether to be based in Stockholm or Örebro. It is a permanent, full-time position with a six month trial period.

In your new role you’ll be responsible for the running of Sitevision-related matters for us. You’ll be in close dialogue with Sitevision, product owners and naturally with your colleagues – different project teams, UX designers, digital planners and other experts here at Strateg. In addition, you’ll keep an eye on Sitevsision’s development, and ensure that your team, too, keeps up to date.

## Your skills

- A few years’ experience in web development
- In-depth knowledge of the Sitevision tool
- Good knowledge in CSS, HTML and JavaScript
- An understanding of UX/UI
- Use GIT

We’ll be even happier if you have experience of other CMS, such as Episerver and WordPress.

Does the shoe fit? Then apply!
