## About your new role

In your new role, you’ll be responsible for the running of Sitevision-related matters for us. Your mission is to create qualitative and sustainable solutions for our customers. You’ll be in close dialogue with Sitevision, product owners and naturally with your colleagues – different project teams, UX designers, digital planners and other experts here at Strateg. In addition, you’ll keep an eye on Sitevision’s development, and ensure that your team, too, keeps up to date.

Strateg is a part of the Diplomat Group, so you can choose whether to be based in Stockholm or Örebro - we can also consider remote working if that suits you better. It is a permanent, full-time position with a six-month trial period.

## Your skills

* A few years’ experience in web development
* In-depth knowledge of the Sitevision tool
* Good knowledge in CSS, HTML and JavaScript
* An understanding of UX/UI
* An understanding of version control (Git)

We’ll be even happier if you have experience of other CMS, such as WordPress and Episerver.

## Good to know

At Strateg, we care about quality and improvement. That’s why, once a week, we have peer code reviews, and hackathon afternoons where one has the ability to work on their own project to learn and experience new languages and technologies.

We also truly value having fun together. We arrange different kinds of activities such as karaoke bar, movie- and theatre nights and every morning at nine o’clock, we gather together for breakfast.

## About Strateg

Strateg is a part of the Diplomat Group with fellow subsidiaries Diplomat Communications and Tale. Together we form one of Sweden’s leading communications advisers. Some 70 employees work at Strateg, with an unusually large dedication and broad expertise to ensure our customers’ success.
