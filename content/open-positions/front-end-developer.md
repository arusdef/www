## Who you are

As a front-end developer, you have a great eye for design, and you fully understand the concept of user experience. You are creative and keen on delivering clever web solutions. In collaborative projects you can take the lead if necessary, because proactivity is in your genes. You are a team player who like to help and share your knowledge. You’re also passionate, open-minded and meticulous about your work.

## Good to know

At Strateg, we care about quality and improvement. That’s why, once a week, we have peer code reviews, and hackathon afternoons where one has the ability to work on their own project to learn and experience new languages and technologies.

We also truly value having fun together. We arrange different kinds of activities such as karaoke bar, movie- and theatre nights and every morning at nine o’clock, we gather together for breakfast.
