title: Hey Google – talk to SJ
excerpt: >-
  With 1,200 daily departures from 284 stations – SJ is the market-leading train
  operating company in Sweden. They have now made it possible to chitchat with
  SJ by using SJ Röststyrning (voice command) in Google Assistant. We helped
  them with a short film – communicating how it all works.

In order to make travelling even more easy (and fun) SJ launched SJ Röststyrning. By using Google assistant, you can now talk to SJ and receive real-time information about departures, arrivals and a lot more.  

We made the film for the launch – and this is the way it turned out.
