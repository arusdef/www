title: Venerable shoe company going back to its roots
excerpt: >-
  In its new marketing, Arbesko takes a giant step forwards by taking an equally
  giant step backwards. The new design language and the new tone are based on
  this venerable company’s history, which is as fascinating as it is long. And
  on their pride in the genuine and authentic craftsmanship they represent.

## Genuine. Local. Craftsmanship. Pride.

Arbesko has a history that’s well worth telling. What started back in 1839 as one of Sweden’s first wholesale shoemakers is now a market-leading company generating annual sales of around SEK 190 million – and manufacturing safety and occupational footwear of the highest quality in what is now Sweden’s only shoe factory. So instead of simply mimicking the competition, they’re now highlighting their unique history and genuine craftsmanship.

## Oxelösund and Umeå

As of now, all product names will be Swedish place names. Places that in some way or other are associated with the development of a particular line of shoes. These names will add to the genuine and authentic feel while also celebrating both the company’s heritage and the fact that Arbesko shoes are still made in Sweden.
