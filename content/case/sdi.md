## Challenge

SDI is a global movement of the urban poor, over 12,5 million people are a part
of the organisation and almost all of them live in slums. On one hand the
organisation needs a brand to unify their voice all over the world to attract
new people to the organisation and appear credible to large donor organisations.
On the other hand, a grass roots movement must keep it very real and close to
its roots, so we have to tread very carefully.

## Insight

SDI needs to attract new, younger members to keep the organisation vital,
vibrant and strong. To reach a younger crowd of slum dwellers, we have worked
with role models. We turned to slum dwellers who have worked in local
communities, and later have travelled the world to inspire more people to join
the movement. The basic insight was basically to use ambassadors to create
aspirational communication.

## Concept

The concept we came up with was “I am a urban poverty fighter”. It’s as simple
as it is powerful. It has been published all over the world, in this case we
created an outdoor campaign in Stockholm in order to create higher awareness
amongst Swedish politicians. We bought ad-space on ten of the poster sites
closest to the parliament and 4000 posters on the subway and commuter trains
in Stockholm.

## Results

The brand material is used in all countries where SDI is present, and it’s
highly appreciated by the slum dwellers. The Stockholm campaign also attracted
organisations to support SDI in the future.
